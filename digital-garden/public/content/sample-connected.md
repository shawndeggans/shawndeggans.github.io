# Sample Connected Content

This is an example of how content can be connected in a digital garden. 

## Connections to Other Ideas

This content references the [[index]] page and demonstrates how the bidirectional linking system works. When you view this page, you'll see that it links to other content, and those pages will show this page in their "Referenced by" section.

## Double Bracket Syntax

Use double brackets to create links: [[another-example]] or [[index]].

These links will automatically be converted to proper navigation links and will create bidirectional connections between content.

## Tags and Metadata

This content has tags that help categorize and filter content. The frontmatter at the top of the markdown file defines:

- Title
- Date
- Tags
- Description (optional)

## Reading Time

The system automatically calculates reading time based on the content length.
