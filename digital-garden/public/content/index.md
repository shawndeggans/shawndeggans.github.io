# Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is my personal digital garden - a space where ideas grow, connect, and evolve over time. Unlike a traditional blog, this space is designed for exploration and discovery.

## How to Navigate

- **Graph View**: Explore the connections between ideas visually
- **Timeline View**: Browse content chronologically
- **Content Pages**: Read individual pieces with related content

## About Digital Gardens

Digital gardens are a way of organizing and sharing knowledge that emphasizes:

- **Non-linear exploration** over chronological reading
- **Connections between ideas** over isolated posts
- **Growth and evolution** over finalized content
- **Personal learning** over polished presentation

## Sample Connections

This introduction connects to [[sample-connected]] content that demonstrates the bidirectional linking system.

## Getting Started

Start by exploring the graph view to see how content connects, or browse the timeline to see what's been added recently.

Enjoy your exploration!
