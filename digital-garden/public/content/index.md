# Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is a place where I explore ideas, share thoughts, and connect concepts in a way that's more true to how knowledge develops - through connections and exploration rather than linear posts.

## What is a Digital Garden?

Unlike traditional blogs, a digital garden is:

- **Non-linear**: Ideas connect to each other in a web, not a timeline
- **Evolving**: Content grows and changes over time
- **Exploratory**: Follow your curiosity rather than chronology

## How to Navigate

You can explore this space in different ways:

- The **Graph View** shows connections between concepts
- The **Timeline View** organizes by when I added or updated content
- The **Tags** can help you find related topics

Happy exploring!
