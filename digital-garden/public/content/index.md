# Curiouser and Curiouser!

Welcome to my digital gardenâ€”a space where ideas grow, branch, and intertwine.

Unlike traditional blogs, this garden thrives on connections. Concepts link to other concepts. Thoughts build upon thoughts. You might enter through one idea and emerge somewhere completely unexpected.

I've planted [[My Core Values]] here alongside practical explorations like [[Building a Semantic Layer]] and architectural musings about [[volatility-based decomposition]]. Each piece connects to others in ways that reveal themselves as you wander.

Feel free to explore. Follow the connections. See where curiosity leads you.

That's what gardens are for.
