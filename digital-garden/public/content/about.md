# About This Digital Garden

Welcome to my digital garden - a space for growing ideas, making connections, and exploring thoughts in a non-linear way.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is different from a traditional blog. Instead of a chronological stream of posts, it's an interconnected web of ideas that grows and evolves over time. Think of it as:

- A **living document** that grows organically
- A **network of thoughts** rather than isolated posts
- A place for **works in progress** and incomplete ideas
- An **exploration tool** for discovering connections

## How to Navigate

This site offers three ways to explore:

### 🌐 Graph View
An interactive visualization showing how all content connects. Click any node to dive into that topic, or hover to see connections.

### 📅 Timeline View
A chronological view of content, perfect for seeing how ideas develop over time. Filter by tags or search for specific topics.

### 🏷️ Tag Network
Explore content through topics and themes. See which tags are most prominent and how they relate to each other.

## About Me

I'm Shawn Deggans, and this is my attempt to think in public and make connections between ideas visible. You'll find thoughts on technology, consulting, learning, and whatever else captures my curiosity.

## Philosophy

> "The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas." - Linus Pauling

This garden is a place for growing ideas - some will flourish, others will be composted into new thoughts. The goal isn't perfection, but exploration and connection.

## Connect

Feel free to explore, follow links, and see where curiosity takes you. Every page is connected to others in some way - that's the magic of the digital garden.
