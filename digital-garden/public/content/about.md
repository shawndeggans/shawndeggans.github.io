# About

I'm Shawn Deggans, a curiosity-driven explorer who has spent 25+ years navigating the intersection of technology and human problems. By day, I serve as Principal Solutions Architect at Applied Curiosity, where I help organizations transform complex technical challenges into practical, measurable business solutions.

## What Drives Me

Curiosity sits at the foundation of everything I do. After two and a half decades in technology, I've learned that the most interesting problems live in the spaces between disciplines—where business strategy meets technical implementation, where data becomes insight, where complexity transforms into elegant simplicity.

I operate by five core principles:

**Locality and Simplicity** — I design solutions that stay close to their problems and maintain elegant simplicity. Clean architecture matters more than clever tricks.

**Focus, Flow, and Joy** — Deep work produces the best solutions. I create environments where concentration thrives and problem-solving becomes genuinely enjoyable.

**Continuous Improvement** — Every process, every method, every day offers opportunities for refinement. I regularly examine how I work and share what I learn.

**Psychological Safety** — Innovation requires environments where people feel secure asking questions, admitting mistakes, and proposing bold ideas.

**Customer Focus** — Every solution must serve real human needs. I start with deep understanding of customer context and validate solutions against actual value.

## Professional Journey

My career has spanned IT operations, web development, system integration, DevOps, data management, and cloud solutions. I've built everything from electronics e-commerce platforms to IoT systems for steel processing plants. I hold certifications as an AWS Solution Architect Associate and Databricks Data Analyst and Data Engineer Associate.

Currently, I focus on data strategy development, enterprise architecture, and the careful art of translating business anxieties into technical solutions. I've guided non-profits through data system modernizations, helped manufacturers implement predictive maintenance through IoT, and designed edge computing systems for Fortune 500 companies.

## This Digital Garden

This space represents my playground—a place for experiments, explorations, and occasional rabbit holes. Unlike traditional blogs that force chronological navigation, this garden embraces non-linear discovery. Ideas connect through relationships rather than publication dates.

You'll find documentation from my professional work alongside personal experiments. I might share insights from architecting data platforms one day and explore plant monitoring telemetry the next. The connections between these seemingly disparate interests often reveal the most interesting patterns.

## Current Explorations

My active projects reflect my curiosity across domains:

- **Documentation systems** that capture knowledge from Jupyter notebooks
- **Momentary apps** and time-focused applications
- **Plant monitoring studies** using IoT and simulation
- **Cloud tools** for managing Databricks budgets and policies
- **Machine learning** examples and explorations

## Technical Palette

Over the years, I've worked across:

**Solution Architecture** • **Data Engineering & Analytics** • **Cloud Solutions (AWS, Azure)** • **IoT Implementation** • **Machine Learning** • **Distributed Systems** • **Web Development**
