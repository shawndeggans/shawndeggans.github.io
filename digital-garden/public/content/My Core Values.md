# My Core Values as a Solution Architect

## Locality and Simplicity

Striving to keep solutions as close to their point of use as possible while maintaining elegant simplicity in design and implementation.

I design systems that are easy to understand and maintain, keeping solutions close to where the problem exists. I avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering, choosing straightforward approaches over clever ones.

## Focus, Flow, and Joy

Creating and maintaining an environment that promotes deep work, continuous progress, and enjoyment in problem-solving.

I structure work to allow for deep focus periods and create systems that enable smooth, uninterrupted workflows. Finding and sharing the joy in technical challenges while maintaining work-life harmony sustains energy and creativity.

## Improvement of Daily Work

Continuously seeking ways to enhance processes, tools, and methods used in daily architectural work.

I regularly reflect on and refine working methods, automating repetitive tasks when beneficial. Sharing improvements with team members and learning from both successes and failures drives constant evolution.

## Psychological Safety

Fostering an environment where team members feel secure in taking risks, asking questions, and admitting mistakes.

I create spaces where open dialogue is welcomed, responding to mistakes with curiosity rather than judgment. I encourage diverse perspectives and ideas while modeling vulnerability and openness to feedback.

## Customer Focus

Maintaining unwavering attention to customer needs, challenges, and success while ensuring solutions truly serve their purpose.

Every solution starts with deep understanding of customer context. I regularly validate solutions against customer needs, make decisions based on customer value, and build lasting relationships through trust and delivery.

These values guide my approach to solution architecture, decision-making, and interactions with teams and customers. They serve as personal principles for professional growth and service delivery.
