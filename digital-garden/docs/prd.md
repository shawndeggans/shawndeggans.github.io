```

## Executive Summary

Transform the current multi-view digital garden into a unified exploration interface with two core pages: a comprehensive home page combining global filtering, unified graph visualization, and timeline view; and individual content reading pages. Eliminate all traditional navigation in favor of a filter-driven discovery model.

## Success Criteria
- Single unified graph displaying both content connections and tag relationships
- Global filter affects both graph and timeline simultaneously  
- Automatic content discovery without manual JSON maintenance
- All tags clickable for instant filtering
- 100% width graph visualization showing complete network
- Zero navigation complexity - just home and content views

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components to Leverage
- Timeline filter system (becomes global filter)
- D3.js graph visualization components
- Markdown content processing
- React Router structure

### Components to Remove/Simplify
- Navigation component and menu system
- Separate tag graph and link graph pages
- About page (convert to content node)
- Manual content indexing system

## Feature Requirements

### FR-001: Unified Graph Visualization

**Priority**: Critical

```gherkin
Feature: Unified Graph Visualization
  As a user exploring content
  I want to see all connections in a single graph
  So that I can discover relationships between ideas, content, and topics

  Rule: All nodes are treated as generic data points

  Scenario: Graph displays unified content and tag network
    Given the system has content files with frontmatter and internal links
    And content files contain tags in frontmatter
    When I view the home page
    Then I should see a single graph containing:
      | node_type | connection_type | example |
      | content   | internal_links  | [[other-page]] connections |
      | content   | tag_assignment  | content-to-tag relationships |
      | tag       | co_occurrence   | tags appearing together |
    And all nodes should be visually identical regardless of type
    And the graph should fill 100% of available width
    And the force simulation should scale to show the complete network

  Scenario: Node interaction navigation
    Given I am viewing the unified graph
    When I click on any node
    Then I should navigate to that content's reading page
    And if the node is a tag, I should see filtered timeline results
```

**Technical Specifications**:
```typescript
interface UnifiedNode {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier (filename or tag name)
  type: 'content' | 'tag';
  label: string;        // Display name
  metadata?: {          // Optional additional data
    date?: string;
    description?: string;
    file_path?: string;
  };
}

interface UnifiedLink {
  source: string;       // Source node ID
  target: string;       // Target node ID
  type: 'internal_link' | 'tag_assignment' | 'tag_cooccurrence';
  weight?: number;      // Connection strength (optional)
}

interface GraphData {
  nodes: UnifiedNode[];
  links: UnifiedLink[];
}
```

### FR-002: Global Filter System

**Priority**: Critical

```gherkin
Feature: Global Content Filtering
  As a user exploring content
  I want to filter all views simultaneously
  So that I can focus on specific topics or timeframes

  Rule: Filter affects both graph and timeline views instantly

  Scenario: Text search filtering
    Given I am on the home page
    When I enter "technology" in the global filter
    Then the graph should highlight nodes containing "technology"
    And the timeline should show only content matching "technology"
    And the filter should search in:
      | search_target | examples |
      | content_titles | file names and frontmatter titles |
      | content_body | markdown content text |
      | tags | frontmatter tag values |

  Scenario: Tag-based filtering
    Given I am on the home page  
    When I click on a tag anywhere on the site
    Then the global filter should populate with that tag
    And both graph and timeline should filter to show only content with that tag
    And the URL should update to reflect the filter state

  Scenario: Filter persistence
    Given I have applied filters on the home page
    When I navigate to a content page and return
    Then my filters should be preserved
    And the views should remain filtered as before
```

**Technical Specifications**:
```typescript
interface FilterState {
  searchText: string;
  selectedTags: string[];
  dateRange?: {
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
  };
}

interface FilteredData {
  nodes: UnifiedNode[];
  links: UnifiedLink[];
  timelineEntries: ContentEntry[];
}
```

### FR-003: Automatic Content Discovery

**Priority**: High

```gherkin
Feature: Automatic File System Integration
  As a content creator
  I want the system to automatically detect content changes
  So that I never need to manually update index files

  Rule: Content discovery happens at build time, not runtime

  Scenario: Adding new content
    Given I have a digital garden project
    When I add a new markdown file to public/content/
    And I commit and push to GitHub
    Then the build process should automatically detect the new file
    And include it in the site's content index
    And make it available in graph and timeline views

  Scenario: Removing content
    Given I have existing content in the system
    When I delete a markdown file from public/content/
    And commit and push to GitHub
    Then the build process should remove it from the content index
    And remove it from graph and timeline views
    And update any broken internal links

  Scenario: Content modification
    Given I have existing content
    When I modify frontmatter or add/remove internal links
    And commit and push to GitHub
    Then the graph connections should update automatically
    And timeline metadata should refresh
```

**Technical Specifications**:
```javascript
// Build-time content discovery script
const contentDiscovery = {
  scanDirectory: 'public/content/',
  outputFile: 'src/data/contentIndex.json',
  excludePatterns: ['*.draft.md', 'README.md'],
  
  processFile: (filePath) => ({
    id: generateId(filePath),
    fileName: path.basename(filePath),
    frontmatter: parseFrontmatter(filePath),
    internalLinks: extractInternalLinks(filePath),
    lastModified: fs.statSync(filePath).mtime
  })
};
```

### FR-004: Simplified Navigation Structure

**Priority**: High

```gherkin
Feature: Two-Page Navigation Model
  As a user
  I want a simple navigation structure
  So that I can focus on content exploration rather than interface complexity

  Rule: Only two page types exist in the application

  Scenario: Home page structure
    Given I navigate to the site root
    Then I should see:
      | component | description |
      | global_filter | Search and tag filtering interface |
      | unified_graph | Combined content and tag network |
      | timeline_view | Filtered chronological content list |
    And I should see no traditional navigation menus
    And I should see no separate page links

  Scenario: Content page structure  
    Given I click on any content node or timeline entry
    Then I should navigate to a dedicated reading page
    And I should see:
      | component | description |
      | content_body | Formatted markdown content |
      | return_link | Single link back to home page |
      | tag_links | Clickable tags that return to filtered home |
    And I should see no other navigation options

  Scenario: URL structure
    Given the simplified navigation model
    Then URLs should follow this pattern:
      | page_type | url_pattern | example |
      | home | / or /#/?filter=term | /#/?filter=technology |
      | content | /#/content/:slug | /#/content/my-article |
```

### FR-005: Enhanced Tag Interaction

**Priority**: Medium

```gherkin
Feature: Universal Tag Linking
  As a user
  I want to click any tag anywhere on the site
  So that I can instantly explore related content

  Rule: Every tag mention becomes a clickable filter trigger

  Scenario: Tag clicking in content view
    Given I am reading a content page
    And the content has tags displayed
    When I click on any tag
    Then I should return to the home page
    And the global filter should be populated with that tag
    And both graph and timeline should show filtered results

  Scenario: Tag clicking in timeline view
    Given I am viewing the timeline
    And timeline entries show their tags
    When I click on any tag
    Then the global filter should update
    And the timeline should filter to show only content with that tag
    And the graph should highlight related nodes

  Scenario: Multiple tag selection
    Given I have one tag already filtered
    When I click an additional tag while holding Ctrl/Cmd
    Then both tags should be added to the filter
    And results should show content containing any of the selected tags
```

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### TI-001: Component Architecture Refactoring

```

### TI-002: Graph Visualization Enhancement

```typescript
// D3.js force simulation configuration
const graphConfig = {
  width: '100%',           // Full container width
  height: '60vh',          // 60% of viewport height
  nodeRadius: 8,           // Standard node size regardless of type
  linkDistance: 100,       // Base distance between connected nodes
  chargeStrength: -300,    // Repulsion force between nodes
  
  forces: {
    link: d3.forceLink().distance(100),
    charge: d3.forceManyBody().strength(-300),
    center: d3.forceCenter(),
    collision: d3.forceCollide().radius(12)
  },
  
  // Zoom and pan configuration
  zoom: {
    min: 0.1,
    max: 4,
    initial: 'fit'         // Scale to fit all nodes initially
  }
};
```

### TI-003: Build Process Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow addition
- name: Generate Content Index
  run: |
    cd digital-garden
    node scripts/generateContentIndex.js
    git add src/data/contentIndex.json
    git diff --cached --exit-code || git commit -m "Auto-update content index"
  
- name: Validate Content Links
  run: |
    cd digital-garden  
    node scripts/validateInternalLinks.js
    # Fail build if broken links detected
```

### TI-004: Performance Optimization

```typescript
// Memoized data processing for large content sets
const useOptimizedGraphData = () => {
  const [contentData] = useContentData();
  const [filterState] = useFilterState();
  
  const graphData = useMemo(() => {
    return processUnifiedGraphData(contentData, filterState);
  }, [contentData, filterState]);
  
  const filteredData = useMemo(() => {
    return applyFiltersToGraph(graphData, filterState);
  }, [graphData, filterState]);
  
  return filteredData;
};
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Home Page Integration Test
```gherkin
Given I navigate to the digital garden home page
When the page loads completely
Then I should see:
  - A global filter input at the top
  - A unified graph visualization below the filter
  - A timeline view below the graph
  - No traditional navigation menus
And the graph should display both content and tag nodes
And the timeline should show chronological content entries
And both views should respond to filter changes
```

### AC-002: Content Discovery Validation
```gherkin
Given I add a new markdown file with frontmatter and internal links
When I push to the GitHub repository
Then the GitHub Actions build should complete successfully
And the new content should appear in the live site
And internal links should create graph connections
And tags should appear as filterable options
And no manual index updates should be required
```

### AC-003: Navigation Simplification Test
```gherkin
Given I am anywhere on the site
Then I should have access to exactly two page types:
  - Home page with graph, timeline, and filter
  - Individual content pages with return navigation
And I should not see:
  - Menu bars or navigation dropdowns
  - Separate pages for different graph views
  - About page in navigation (it should be a content node)
```
